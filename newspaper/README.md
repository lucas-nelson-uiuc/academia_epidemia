## Project
Using Python, I created a faux newspaper that scrapes various, reliable websites for information I'd like to see at the start of my morning. With modules such as `BeautifulSoup`, `requests`, `webbrowser`, and more, **the newspaper can gather real-time, ad-free data in seconds.**

## Philosophy
Within moments of reading my Python scripts, it's clear that I was a novice at the time. Functions could have reduced line count and frustration count exponentially, and classes would have allowed for reproducibility among the common features of each website.
