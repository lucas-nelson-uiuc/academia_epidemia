## Project
Using Python, I created a faux newspaper that scrapes various, reliable websites for information I'd like to see at the start of my morning. With modules such as `BeautifulSoup`, `requests`, `webbrowser`, and more, **the newspaper can gather real-time, ad-free data in seconds.**

## History + Philosophy
Realizing how much time I spent on websites that consumed more of my time than necessary and littering my screen with advertisements, I spent a couple days over winter break learning, designing, and producing this here newspaper. Its name derives from the label I've assigned to all self-learning ventures.

Although I was a novice at the time, this was my first self-developed, self-maintained project. Looking back, I could have utilized plenty more functions to generalize and reduce code, and classes to create instances that share common attributes. Will a massive update come around? Maybe. Am I content with a less-than-perfect project that saves me hours of my life and reminds me of the first time I stepped out of my comfort zone? Absolutely.
