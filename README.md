<b>Purpose</b> <br>
A collection of projects that stem from my curiosity and are curtailed for my consumption.

## Featured Projects
### 1. newsPaper
<i>Completed: 01/05/2021<br></i>
Collection of Python, HTML, and CSS documents that scrape, compile, and present information from various websites onto one HTML document for my consumption. Using Python libraries like `webbrowser`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `requests`, I scraped up-to-date information related to local weather forecasts, global politics, various sports leagues and their standings, <i>The History Channel</i>'s fact of the day, and much more. This script will write said information onto a file specific to that information before being manipulated on one final Python script that stitches the information into one final HTML document. The result is a webpage (designed via HTML, styled via CSS) that consistently provides updated information on what matters to me without the hassle of navigating multiple web pages nor at the risk of coming across distractions.

### 2. gradeCalculator
<i>Completed: 12/06/2020<br></i>
Python script that returns my semester GPA. Completed by first inputting my list of classes per semester, categories (homework, midterms, projects, etc.) per class, and graded assignments per category. After computing a course's specific grade for all courses in a given semester, a stylized table is returned to display basic statistics about my performance.
