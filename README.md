<b>Purpose</b> <br>
A collection of projects that stem from my curiosity and are curtailed for my consumption.

<b>About Me</b> <br>
My name is Lucas Nelson and I am a junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. For those who are curious, I study statistics and econometrics, and I always look for any and all opportunities to participate in applications of the material of these fields. What I have learned so far - and by default, will continue to learn - is that applications are growing exponentially, and while I'd like to know all of these applications, I hope that my repository reflects that I am focused on what matters most to me.

As a student, it goes without saying that there are errors in my code and methods, and I'm better off knowing that I'm making mistakes in the process of building my coding and reasoning skills than merely prancing through Python, R, HTML, CSS, etc. telling myself I am an experienced veteran. I'm not (for now). But, hopefully, this repository can reflect my progression in an array of skills that a statistician like myself must adapt to and excel at relative to competition.

That being said, please enjoy DigBeta (just a play on words for 'Big Data' that I came up with in high school) and feel free to critique what you see, old and new. I would appreciate hearing such criticisms (email, LinkedIn, whatever is convenient) and learning from them, even if it's an angrily-worded complaint for the excessive number of lines of code I use!
