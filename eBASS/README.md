# eBASS : What is it?

As the end of my time at university is slowly (but quickly) coming to an end, I've realized that I might not be the best at budgeting my money. Trying to combat this issue, I've decided to put what I might (still) not be the best at to use to help me alleviate this problem: my programming skills.

Welcome eBASS, the *electronic Budget Analysis Spreadsheet System*. (Really, I just liked the cBASS acronym for my cBASS project, so I've kept the nomenclature going.) Although this terminal application is only one half of the project I have in mind, this is where most of the traffic is coming in and out of my eBASS system.
