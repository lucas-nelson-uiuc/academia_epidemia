## Project
Using `Tkinter`, I developed this GUI that allows users to update, recall, and delete accounts and their corresponding usernames and passwords. At its surface, it is a file reading/writing script, but at its core, its a self-made encryption/decryption system to secure your account information.

## How to Use
Once you have a copy of the script, you can `Update` and `Delete` as many accounts as you desire. To access an account's username and password, select any account and press `q` three times. The username and password will appear at the bottom of the screen.

Changes are made behind the scenes but cannot be in observed in real time (changes will save to a file - you'll have to restart the GUI to see the changes). Make sure you have an `accounts.txt` file in the same directory as `securePy`.

## Purpose
By creating many accounts for many job applications, I realized that my go-to passwords were not accepted and I could not remember the details of all these newly created accounts. Hence, I created `securePy` to safely store and recall usernames and passwords - at least, I believe its safe.
