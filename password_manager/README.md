## Project
Using `Tkinter`, I developed this GUI that allows users to update, recall, and delete accounts and their corresponding passwords. At its surface, it is a file reading/writing script, but at its core, its a self-made encryption/decryption system to secure your passwords.

## How to Use
Once you have a copy of the script, you can `Update` and `Delete` as many accounts and passwords as you desire. Changes are made behind the scenes but cannot be in observed in real time (changes will save to a file but you'll have to restart the GUI to see the changes). Make sure you have an `accounts.txt` file in the same directory as `securePy`.

## Purpose
By creating many accounts for job applications, I realized that my go-to passwords were not accepted and I could not remember all of them. Hence, I created `securePy` to safely store and recall passwords for me - at least, I believe its safe.
